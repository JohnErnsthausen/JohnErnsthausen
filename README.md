# Hello, I'm John Ernsthausen

I'm a web developer for Smarty Pixels, a computational science engineer, and a research software developer who is passionate about making open-source more accessible, creating technology to elevate people, and building community.
I'm curious, think critically, and plan strategically. I apply a wide range of technical skills to solve impossible problems with great ideas and a get it done, can do attitude. Curious about my qualifications, find my full resume in the footer of [johnernsthausen.com](http://www.johnernsthausen.com).

Static websites are a beautiful thing. I innovate with the blog aware, open source static website generator Jekyll and use Git as the Content Management System (CMS), creatively integrating all the dynamic content. I enjoy building for businesses. I especially enjoy totally simplifying their technology footprint and their maintenance effort with results that delight.

You can get more business with Smarty Pixels! Let us build a website that solves all your business needs.
