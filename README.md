# Hello, I'm John Ernsthausen

I'm a web developer, computational science engineer, and research software developer who is passionate about making open-source more accessible, creating technology to elevate people, and building community.
I'm curious, think critically, and plan strategically. I apply a wide range of technical skills to solve impossible problems with great ideas and a get it done, can do attitude.

Static websites are a beutiful thing. I innovate with the blog aware, open source static website generator Jekyll and use Git as the Content Management Ststem (CMS), creatively integrating all the dynamic content. I enjoy building for businesses that totally simplifies their technology footprint.
